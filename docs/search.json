    "text": "Summary\n\n2022 saw less than half of the electorate turn out to vote in-person and on Election Day.\nPre-polling and postal voting continued to become more prevalent methods of voting in 2022, accounting for 33% and 14% of 2022 turnout, respectively (Table 1; Figure 1).\nCoalition voters are more likely to use pre-polling or postal votes. In 2022, Coalition House candidates did 3 percentage points better in pre-polls than in other forms of voting, and 6 percentage points better in postal votes than in other forms of voting (Table 2; Table 3).\nThe six C200-supported candidates successfully elected to the House of Representatives typically under-performed in postal votes relative to other forms of voting (Figure 2). In part, this is due to the demographic and political dispositions of electors availing themselves of postal voting.\nBut incumbent independents (e.g., Wilkie, Steggall, Haines, Sharkie) did just as well or better among postal votes relative to other forms of voting.\nWhy? Does incumbency confer advantages on candidates with respect to shifting their voters to postal voting? If so, what are those advantages? Or alternatively, are incumbents doing a better job attracting the votes of electors committed to voting by mail?\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nSection 90B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act entitles successful House of Representatives candidates to a version of the electoral roll with postal voting information appended for each voter; in particular see section 90B(10). Analysis of that information will be vital in helping answer the questions posed above, and to ensure that postal voting etc are not points of vulnerability for Independent candidates in future elections.\nPooling this information from the AEC across multiple divisions would strengthen the analytical power and practical utility of this proposed analysis.\nGiven restrictions on access to the electoral roll, legal advice can inform if and how this combined analysis can be undertaken.\n\n\n\nVote types in Australian federal elections\nThe AEC classifies votes as follows:\n\nordinary votes: cast in person at polling places, typically in the elector’s division of enrolment or at designated voting centres in capital cities and provincial centres adjoining that division. In 2019 83.2% of electors turned out to vote this way. The AEC includes pre-poll votes in this group, votes cast in person at pre-polling voting centres (PPVCs) or AEC divisional offices.\n\nThere are four types of declaration votes, where the voter signs a declaration instead of being marked off against the roll:\n\npostal votes: electors may request a mail ballot from the AEC and return it through the post. This is the most prevalent form of declaration voting, and form the vast bulk of the ballots counted after election night, as many postal votes have been returned to the AEC before Election Day.\nabsent votes: votes cast on Election Day, in person at a polling place, by electors outside of their division of enrolment (but still within their state or territory).\ndeclaration pre-poll votes: pre-poll ballots cast away from the elector’s division of enrolment.\nprovisional votes: ballots cast subject to AEC verification of the voter’s claim to be enrolled and entitled to vote in a particular division (typically used in cases of errors in names or addresses on the roll) or when the voter is registered as a silent elector.\n\n\n\nChange in prevalence of voting types, 2019 to 2022\n\n\n\nTable 1 shows the change in rates of the three most prevalent voting types between the 2019 and 2022 federal elections at the divisional level. Postal voting and pre-polling continued to surge in popularity in 2022. Postals and PPVCs have become more prevalent while in-person, Election Day voting has become less popular, accounting for less than 46% of 2022 turnout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 displays the rates at which voters use different methods of voting by division, comparing 2019 rates (horizontal axis) to 2022 rates (vertical axis).

Each column of plots corresponds to a form of voting; the two rows separate divisions by whether C200 provided support. Each data point is a House of Representatives division; percentages are of method of voting (including informal ballots). Orange lines indicate trends. Roll over each data point to display division name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences in vote support across voting type\nConventionally, (a) major parties outperform minor parties and independents on postals; (b) the Coalition generally outperforms Labor on postals, but this out-performance is less pronounced and even reversed in other forms of voting.\nThe reasons for this are straightforward:\n\nmajor parties have the organisational resources to make use of the AEC’s data on who votes by post etc, to send out applications for postal ballots, to track changes of addresses given their access to to the roll\nolder, wealthier voters make use of postal voting, both for convenience and because they have more time and resources to apply for the ballot, complete it and mail it back. This segment of the electorate skews towards the Coalition.\n\nThese patterns are evident in differences in party performance across voting types in the 2022 election, using figures available at this stage of the count, as shown in the following two tables. Table 2 shows first-preference, House of Representatives percentages for each party in 2022 by vote type; Table 3 presents the same data but with each party’s vote share by vote type expressed relative to that party’s performance in other vote types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 2022 data are consistent with the patterns observed in previous elections:\n\nthe Coalition over-performs with postal votes and early voting at PPVCs, and under-performs with in Election Day, in-person voting at polling places.\nwhile the Coalition is huge over-performer with respect to postal votes, Labor under-performance is close to zero.\nRelatively few Coalition voters cast a provisional ballot, with Green and Labor voters more likely to vote this way.\nThe Greens have a disproportionate share of absentee votes, and their voters do better in Election Day, in-person voting at polling places.\nVotes for Independent candidates are disproportionately cast in-person on Election Day, but are less likely to be cast as postal votes.\n\n\n\nEven successful C200-supported candidates lagged in postal votes\nFigure 2 disaggregates the data shown in summary form above for postal voting. The preference for postal voting among Coalition voters — and in seats held by the Coalition — is clearly apparent (filled circles in Figure 2 denote seats held by the indicated party going into the 2022 election), with almost all Coalition candidates faring better in postal votes than in other vote types.\nA strong performance is postal votes is hardly a guarantee of electoral success, and indeed, could well be a sign of electoral weakness (e.g., that a party’s support is overly concentrated in an older segment of an electorate). Figure 2 highlights that losing Coalition incumbents in Wentworth, Goldstein, Curtin, Kooyong, Mackellar and North Sydney had strong over-performance among postal votes.\nThe picture is mixed for Labor candidates, with many Labor incumbents in particular recording small to moderate over-performances among postal votes. Among postal votes, Green candidates almost always under-perform relative to their performance among other forms of voting, including their sole incumbent going into the 2022 election, Adam Bandt (Melbourne).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npd = transpose(pd_raw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot.plot({\n  grid: true,\n  width: 1000,\n  height: 1000,\n  insetBottom: 2,\n  insetTop: 2,\n  \n  style: {\n    fontSize: \"16px\"\n  },\n  \n  y: {\n    domain: [-16, 17],\n    ticks: 17,\n    tickFormat: \"+\",\n    label: \"Share of postal vote minus vote share among other vote types (percentage points) ↑\"\n  },\n  \n  x: {\n    label: \"\"\n  },\n\n  facet: {\n    data: pd,\n    x: \"party_group\",\n    frame: false,\n    marginTop: 50,\n    marginLeft: 0,\n    marginRight: 0,\n    marginBottom: 30\n    },\n    \n  fx: {\n    padding: 0.1,\n    label: \"\"\n  },\n  \n  marks: [\n  \n    Plot.ruleY([0], {stroke: \"#333\"}),\n  \n    Plot.dot(pd,\n      Plot.dodgeX(\n        {\n          filter: (d) => !d.highlight,\n          y: \"perf\",\n          anchor: \"middle\",\n          padding: 2,\n          r: 4,\n          title: (d) => `${d.Division} (${d.State}) \\n ${d3.format(\"+.1f\")(d.perf)} \\n ${d.name}`,\n          stroke: (d) => d.color,\n          fill: (d) => d.incumbent_2022 ? d.color : \"transparent\"\n        }\n      )\n    ),\n    \n     Plot.text(pd,\n      Plot.dodgeX(\n      {\n        filter: \"highlight\",\n        y: \"perf\",\n        anchor: \"middle\",\n        padding: 50,\n        text: (d) => (d.incumbent_2022 ?

Each point shows the difference between a candidate’s share of the postal vote and their share of all other vote types. Incumbents (or candidates of incumbent parties) are denoted with filled circles, challengers are shown with open circles; data for C200-supported independents are coloured teal; Sharkie (XEN; Mayo, SA) and Katter (KAP; Kennedy, QLD) are denoted as IND for inclusion in the graph. Data are randomly jittered in the horizontal dimension to show the density of the data and to avoid overplotting. Roll over each data point to display details.\n\n\n\nMost independent candidacies are quixotic, generating low vote shares that vary little across vote types; as show in Figure 2, postal vote shares for most independents are identical to their vote shares in other forms of voting.\nBut like Labor and Coalition candidates, incumbent independents tend to do better among postal votes than among other forms of voting. For non-incumbent independents, including the successful, C200-supported candidates, their performance among postal vote lags their performance across over types of voting, and by substantial margins.\n\n\nPostal vote performance and incumbency\nWe look closer at relative performance in postal votes (RPV), comparing established, incumbent independents and independents challenging incumbents (or candidates of incumbent parties).\nWe also include data from 2019 — when at least two of 2022’s incumbent independents were challengers (Haines and Steggall) — to start to assess the role of incumbency as a predictor of postal vote performance. Further, in 2019, Kerryn Phelps was the independent incumbent in Wentworth, challenged successfully by Dave Sharma, who in turn was challenged successfully by independent Allegra Spender in 2022.\nThese within-division comparisons have the benefit of holding constant any time-invariant, divisional-level factors that might influence the postal vote performance of independents, while at the same time capturing some variation in the incumbency status of independent candidates.\nTable 4 presents data from this relatively small set of independent candidacies, showing (a) the level of postal vote performance relative to other vote types for both 2019 and 2022 (RPV), (b) the change (∆) in RPV as well as (c) the prevalence of postal voting in the division in 2019 and 2022 and (d) change in prevalance. We also note the incumbency status of the independent candidate in each case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis small number of cases highlights again that (a) incumbent independents typically do better in postal votes than in other forms of voting; (b) that becoming an incumbent boosts postal vote performance, as evidenced by the experience of Haines (Indi, VIC) and Steggall (Warringah, NSW), both transitioning relative under-performance among postals to over-performance as they transitioned from challenger to incumbent between the 2019 and 2022 elections:\n\nHaines’ relative performance among postal votes (RPV) goes from -4.0 to +1.5 between 2019 and 2022, a gain of 5.5 percentage points;\nSteggall’s RPV rises from -6.8 as a challenger in 2019 to +1.6 in 2022, a gain of 8.4 percentage points.\n\nThese two data points can be distinguished from the changes in RPVs for independent candidates who did not transition from challenger to incumbent:\n\nSharkie (Mayo, SA) also sees a 5.5 improvement in RPV as an incumbent in both elections, the same as Haines, while Wilkie’s RPV falls -1.2 percentage points.\nChanges in RPV for the other cases — -4.0 for Dyson (Wannon, VIC), a challenger in both elections, and -1.2 Spender relative to Phelps (Wentworth NSW) — further suggest that incumbency is positively associated with RPV.\n\nMoreover, changes in the prevalence of postal voting are almost constant over this set of divisions, with little prospect of any confounding of the effect of incumbency on RPV with the increase in the use of postal voting between 2019 and 2022.\n\n\n\nStatistical tests confirm that incumbency promotes postal vote performance. We estimate regressions of 2019-to-2022 change in RPV, with two predictors:\n\nchange in incumbency between 2019 and 2022 (+1 for 2019 challenger to 2022 incumbent, 0 for no change and -1 for 2019 incumbent to 2022 challenger)\nchange in the prevalence of postal voting in each division, 2019 to 2022, so that estimates of the incumbency changes are net of any effects on RPV due to the increase in the prevalence of postal voting.\n\nWe estimate this regression separately for Coalition, Independent candidates and Labor candidates. Green candidates are omitted from this “differences-in-differences” analysis, since there is no variation in the incumbency status of Greens candidates between 2019 and 2022, with Adam Bandt remaining the sole Greens House of Representatives incumbent in both elections. We also fit this model to differences in relative performance in votes cast at pre-poll voting centres (PPVC), the other vote type to surge in popularity in 2022.\nFigure 3 presents these regression-based estimates of the effects of a transition to incumbency in graphical form: points correspond to the magnitude of the estimated effects and vertical lines cover 95% confidence intervals.\nAs foreshadowed in the tables and charts above, the effects of transitioning to incumbency are large for independents, and are also positive and distinguishable from zero for Coalition (1.4, \\(t\\) = 1.8) and Labor candidates (1.9, \\(t\\) = 2.2).

As postal votes continue to grow in popularity, understanding the mechanisms by which this advantage arises will be vital as a general proposition, but in particular for C200-supported independents, holding seats traditionally considered Coalition-strongholds, seats in which the use of postal voting is higher than average.\nIn addition to quantitative data analysis, qualitative work with established, incumbent independents (Steggall, Haines, Sharkie, Wilkie) will help shed light on these mechanisms.\nSection 90B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act entitles successful House of Representatives candidates to a version of the electoral roll with postal voting information appended for each voter; in particular see section 90B(10). Analysis of that information will be vital in helping answer the questions posed above, and to ensure that postal voting etc are not points of vulnerability for Independent candidates in future elections.\nPooling this information from the AEC across multiple divisions would strengthen the analytical power and practical utility of this proposed analysis.\nGiven restrictions on access to the electoral roll, legal advice can inform if and how this combined analysis can be undertaken."

The median population of the non-empty SA1s was 406.\nAfter each federal election, the AEC produces a data file that provides voter turnout counts at each of the polling places utilised by voters residing in each SA1.\nThis mapping from polling places to SA1s is a helpful tool in understanding the social and demographic correlates of the vote at a reasonably fine-grained level, exploiting the facts that the AEC supplies (1) vote tallies by party at the polling place level and (2) the Census provides social and demographic characteristics at the SA1 level.\nThese data are also helpful for political parties and other groups, in that they permit us to form estimates of the political characteristics of SA1s, that in turn provide a basis for on-the-ground campaigning and mobilisation, identifying geographic targets-of-opportunity.\nA number of interesting methodological challenges arise in using data of this sort: votes by party are tabulated at the polling place level while Census characteristics are tabulated at the SA1 level. While the AEC SA1 file provides voter turnout counts by SA1 and polling place, we can not, in general, recover votes by party for SA1s exactly. This inferential problem is known as an “inverse problem” in mathematics and statistics, one in which we try to recover the unobserved inputs that generated observed outputs; in this case the inverse problem is said to be ill-posed in that no unique solution typically exists, with a range of possible inputs consistent with the observed outputs. In the social sciences this problem is called the “ecological” or “cross-level” inference problem, with a long and distinguished lineage."

Figure 1 shows that the modal number of polling places used per SA1 is 17, with a small cluster of SA1s whose voters make use of just 1 polling place.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Histogram, number of polling places used per SA1\n\n\n\n\nWe also examine the concentration or diffusion of voters across polling places within each SA1. We first compute \\(p_{ij}\\), the proportion of voters from SA1 \\(i\\) who vote at polling place \\(j \\in 1, \\ldots, n_i\\). The Gini-Simpson index \\[\nG_i = 1 - \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} p_{ij}^2\n\\] measures the diversity of the \\(p_{ij}\\) within SA1 \\(i\\) and in this case is equal to the probability that two randomly sampled voters in the \\(i\\)-th SA1 turned out at different polling places.\nFigure 2 shows a series of plots of the largest value of \\(p_{ij}\\) for each SA1plotted against the Gini-Simpson diversity index \\(G_i\\), over a range of values for \\(n_i\\), the number of polling places utilised by voters in a particular SA1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Concentration/diversity of voter turnout locations for each SA1; vertical axis is the share of voter turnout recorded at the most utilised polling place for a SA1; horizontal axis is the Gini-Simpson diversity index, the probability that two randomly selected voters from a SA1 turned out to vote at the same polling place.\n\n\n\n\nIn the following table we examine the spread of SA1 votes across polling places as follows: for a given SA1 we order the contributing polling places by the number of votes from the SA1 cast at that polling place. We then compute the cumulative share of SA1 turnout as we go from the largest/most-utilised polling place to the smallest/least-utilised polling place. After a cumulative \\(j\\) polling places, we compute the median proportion of a SA1’s turnout and the 5th and 95th percentile of the cumulative turnout across SA1s. These quantities are reported in the table below:\n\n\n\n\ntab_spread = transpose(tab_ojs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputs.table(tab_spread, {\n  columns: [\n    \"i\",\n    \"q50\",\n    \"q05\",\n    \"q95\"\n    ],\n    align: {\n      i: \"center\",\n      q50: \"center\",\n      q05: \"center\",\n      q95: \"center\"\n    },\n    format: {\n      i: x => x.toFixed(0),\n      q50: x => (100*x).toFixed(1),\n      q05: x => (100*x).toFixed(1),\n      q95: x => (100*x).toFixed(1)\n      },\n   header: {\n    i: \"Cumulative polling places\",\n    q50: \"Cumulative share of SA1 turnout (median)\",\n    q05: \"5%\",\n    q95: \"95%\" \n    }\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis inspection of the data reveals\n\ntypically, combining results from many polling places will be required to generate estimates of vote shares at the SA1 level;\nwhile it is sometimes the case that one or two polling places account for the bulk of votes from a given SA1, this is relatively unusual. More often than not, even six polling places account for less than 90% of the turnout of a SA1, and typically about nine polling places are required to account for 95% of turnout in any SA1."

    "text": "Errors at polling places?\nTurning out in-person on Election Day at a polling place accounted for 45.3% of 2022 turnout, remaining the single most prevalent method of voter turnout as the popularity of pre-polling and postal voting has surged. Another 33% of 2022 turnout was via in-person voting at a pre-poll voting centre (PPVC).\nBoth forms of voting begin with an individual presenting themselves to election officials at a polling place. The election official asks the individual for their name and address (S229, CEA) so as to uniquely locate the individual on the certified list (the “roll”) of eligible voters for that electoral division.\nElection officials then “mark off” the voter on the roll as having turned out as per S232 CEA, a key moment in Australia’s system of compulsory turnout, where the citizen is recorded as having fulfilled their duty to vote as prescribed by S245 CEA. Given that this is a “one-to-one” matching exercise performed by an election official (locating an individual voter on the electronic roll, appending that information with a record of the voter turning out), how can errors in the turnout count possibly arise?\nAfter verification that the individual presenting themselves is an enrolled voter, the AEC official issues balloting materials to the voter (S231, CEA) and the voter’s marking of the ballot takes place “in private” (S233, CEA). No further check of identity takes place when a ballot is deposited into a ballot box, nor is there any formal check that individuals marked off the roll and issued ballot papers actually do return the papers to ballot boxes.\nS339(1)(e) establishes that to “fraudulently take any ballot paper out of any polling booth or counting center” is an offence. But otherwise failing to place a ballot in a ballot box does not appear to be an offence. Indeed, S238A deals with the handling of “discarded ballot papers” by election officials, so clearly the notion that not all issued ballots are deposited in ballot boxes is contemplated by the AEC.\nAccordingly, discrepancies between the SA1 file counts and AEC results files for in-person, polling places could arise via\n\nerrors made by election officials when marking off voters against the electoral roll, perhaps “marking off” more than one record on the roll (contributing to an overcount on the SA1 file), or failing to mark off the voter against the roll (contributing to an undercount).\nvoters not returning issued ballot papers to ballot boxes (contributing to an overcount in the SA1 file)\nballot papers being lost after being deposited in ballot boxes (contributing to an overcount in the SA1 file); or\nerrors in counting ballot papers (generating overcounts or undercounts relative to the SA1 file)\nthe possibility that deliberate errors are introduced by the AEC in constructing the SA1 file, with a small level of random “noise” in the counts so as to protect the anonymity of voters, given that cell counts are small in the SA1 file.\n\nNote that fraudulently voting multiple times (presumably while impersonating another voter, both offences under S339 CEA) would not generate an overcount in the SA-1 file, but more likely an undercount (more votes going into ballot boxes than there are unique voters presenting themselves to polling places), and perhaps not even that."

Details vary across these methods, but all of these methods see the voter providing written information as to their address and/or division of enrolment. How, then, might discrepancies arise between the SA1 turnout counts and the AEC results? Possibilities include:\n\nDeclaration votes issued by the AEC to voters but not returned.\nDeclaration votes issued and returned but rejected during scrutiny for validity (see Schedule 3, CEA) and not added to the vote count, not even as an informal ballot.\n\nIn both of these cases an overcount on the SA1 file might arise if a voter is “marked off” as having turned out but the ballot is not entered into the count for the reasons given above."

This is an unusual outcome, a situation where there are more ballots recorded in the vote count than there are voters recorded as turning out\nOne possibility is error by an official at the polling place, neglecting to “mark off” a voter, yet still issuing ballot papers to the voter.\nFor declaration votes, perhaps voters requesting declaration or pre-poll ballot are being issued ballot papers from the wrong division, such that they are “marked off” as having voted in their division of enrolment, but wind up casting a ballot in another division (which is rejected at scrutiny). This would contribute to the AEC results turnout count in a division, without an increment in the SA1 file’s count for that polling-place/division."

Consistent with the universalism inherent in Australia’s system of compulsory voter enrolment and turnout, the franchise is not restricted to citizens with a fixed place of residence and S96 CEA deals with the enrolment of “itinerant electors”.\nThe ABS uses special SA1 codes ending in 49999 for 30,831 Australian citizens counted by the 2021 Census but without a fixed address; the corresponding count on the 2016 Census file (recalling that 2016 SA1s are used by the AEC on the 2022 SA1 turnout file) is 27,960. None of the 2016 ABS SA1 codes for “no fixed address” appear on the SA1 file.\nWe should not expect especially high turnout among the adult, citizen, itinerant population. Nonetheless it seems that any itinerant voters that do turn out would not contribute to the counts on the SA1 file. In turn, turnout by itinerant electors will push the SA1 file in the direction of a turnout undercount relative to AEC results."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\n\n2022 saw less than half of the electorate turn out to vote in-person and on Election Day.\nPre-polling and postal voting continued to become more prevalent methods of voting in 2022, accounting for 33% and 14% of 2022 turnout, respectively (Table 1; Figure 1).\nCoalition voters are more likely to use pre-polling or postal votes. In 2022, Coalition House candidates did 3 percentage points better in pre-polls than in other forms of voting, and 6 percentage points better in postal votes than in other forms of voting (Table 2; Table 3).\nThe six C200-supported candidates successfully elected to the House of Representatives typically under-performed in postal votes relative to other forms of voting (Figure 2). In part, this is due to the demographic and political dispositions of electors availing themselves of postal voting.\nBut incumbent independents (e.g., Wilkie, Steggall, Haines, Sharkie) did just as well or better among postal votes relative to other forms of voting.\nWhy? Does incumbency confer advantages on candidates with respect to shifting their voters to postal voting?\nSection 90B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act entitles “a member of the House of Representatives” to a version of the electoral roll with information as to whether each voter is a “general postal voter” inter alia, see section 90B(10). Candidates who are not incumbent member of the House are not entitled to this information, but merely a “copy of a certified list of voters” (see section 90B(1), item 1). We conjecture that this is a likely source of the asymmetry in incumbency advantage we observe in postal votes.\n\n\n\nVote types in Australian federal elections\nThe AEC classifies votes as follows:\n\nordinary votes: cast in person at polling places, typically in the elector’s division of enrolment or at designated voting centres in capital cities and provincial centres adjoining that division. In 2019 83.2% of electors turned out to vote this way. The AEC includes pre-poll votes in this group, votes cast in person at pre-polling voting centres (PPVCs) or AEC divisional offices.\n\nThere are four types of declaration votes, where the voter signs a declaration instead of being marked off against the roll:\n\npostal votes: electors may request a mail ballot from the AEC and return it through the post. This is the most prevalent form of declaration voting, and form the vast bulk of the ballots counted after election night, as many postal votes have been returned to the AEC before Election Day.\nabsent votes: votes cast on Election Day, in person at a polling place, by electors outside of their division of enrolment (but still within their state or territory).\ndeclaration pre-poll votes: pre-poll ballots cast away from the elector’s division of enrolment.\nprovisional votes: ballots cast subject to AEC verification of the voter’s claim to be enrolled and entitled to vote in a particular division (typically used in cases of errors in names or addresses on the roll) or when the voter is registered as a silent elector.\n\n\n\nChange in prevalence of voting types, 2019 to 2022\n\n\n\nTable 1 shows the change in rates of the three most prevalent voting types between the 2019 and 2022 federal elections at the divisional level. Postal voting and pre-polling continued to surge in popularity in 2022. Postals and PPVCs have become more prevalent while in-person, Election Day voting has become less popular, accounting for less than 46% of 2022 turnout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 displays the rates at which voters use different methods of voting by division, comparing 2019 rates (horizontal axis) to 2022 rates (vertical axis).

Each column of plots corresponds to a form of voting; the two rows separate divisions by whether C200 provided support. Each data point is a House of Representatives division; percentages are of method of voting (including informal ballots). Orange lines indicate trends. Roll over each data point to display division name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences in vote support across voting type\nConventionally, (a) major parties outperform minor parties and independents on postals; (b) the Coalition generally outperforms Labor on postals, but this out-performance is less pronounced and even reversed in other forms of voting.\nThe reasons for this are straightforward:\n\nmajor parties have the organisational resources to make use of the AEC’s data on who votes by post etc, to send out applications for postal ballots, to track changes of addresses given their access to to the roll\nolder, wealthier voters make use of postal voting, both for convenience and because they have more time and resources to apply for the ballot, complete it and mail it back. This segment of the electorate skews towards the Coalition.\n\nThese patterns are evident in differences in party performance across voting types in the 2022 election, using figures available at this stage of the count, as shown in the following two tables. Table 2 shows first-preference, House of Representatives percentages for each party in 2022 by vote type; Table 3 presents the same data but with each party’s vote share by vote type expressed relative to that party’s performance in other vote types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 2022 data are consistent with the patterns observed in previous elections:\n\nthe Coalition over-performs with postal votes and early voting at PPVCs, and under-performs with in Election Day, in-person voting at polling places.\nwhile the Coalition is huge over-performer with respect to postal votes, Labor under-performance is close to zero.\nRelatively few Coalition voters cast a provisional ballot, with Green and Labor voters more likely to vote this way.\nThe Greens have a disproportionate share of absentee votes, and their voters do better in Election Day, in-person voting at polling places.\nVotes for Independent candidates are disproportionately cast in-person on Election Day, but are less likely to be cast as postal votes.\n\n\n\nEven successful C200-supported candidates lagged in postal votes\nFigure 2 disaggregates the data shown in summary form above for postal voting. The preference for postal voting among Coalition voters — and in seats held by the Coalition — is clearly apparent (filled circles in Figure 2 denote seats held by the indicated party going into the 2022 election), with almost all Coalition candidates faring better in postal votes than in other vote types.\nA strong performance is postal votes is hardly a guarantee of electoral success, and indeed, could well be a sign of electoral weakness (e.g., that a party’s support is overly concentrated in an older segment of an electorate). Figure 2 highlights that losing Coalition incumbents in Wentworth, Goldstein, Curtin, Kooyong, Mackellar and North Sydney had strong over-performance among postal votes.\nThe picture is mixed for Labor candidates, with many Labor incumbents in particular recording small to moderate over-performances among postal votes. Among postal votes, Green candidates almost always under-perform relative to their performance among other forms of voting, including their sole incumbent going into the 2022 election, Adam Bandt (Melbourne).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npd = transpose(pd_raw)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot.plot({\n  grid: true,\n  width: 1000,\n  height: 1000,\n  insetBottom: 2,\n  insetTop: 2,\n  \n  style: {\n    fontSize: \"16px\"\n  },\n  \n  y: {\n    domain: [-16, 17],\n    ticks: 17,\n    tickFormat: \"+\",\n    label: \"Share of postal vote minus vote share among other vote types (percentage points) ↑\"\n  },\n  \n  x: {\n    label: \"\"\n  },\n\n  facet: {\n    data: pd,\n    x: \"party_group\",\n    frame: false,\n    marginTop: 50,\n    marginLeft: 0,\n    marginRight: 0,\n    marginBottom: 30\n    },\n    \n  fx: {\n    padding: 0.1,\n    label: \"\"\n  },\n  \n  marks: [\n  \n    Plot.ruleY([0], {stroke: \"#333\"}),\n  \n    Plot.dot(pd,\n      Plot.dodgeX(\n        {\n          filter: (d) => !d.highlight,\n          y: \"perf\",\n          anchor: \"middle\",\n          padding: 2,\n          r: 4,\n          title: (d) => `${d.Division} (${d.State}) \\n ${d3.format(\"+.1f\")(d.perf)} \\n ${d.name}`,\n          stroke: (d) => d.color,\n          fill: (d) => d.incumbent_2022 ? d.color : \"transparent\"\n        }\n      )\n    ),\n    \n     Plot.text(pd,\n      Plot.dodgeX(\n      {\n        filter: \"highlight\",\n        y: \"perf\",\n        anchor: \"middle\",\n        padding: 50,\n        text: (d) => (d.incumbent_2022 ?

Each point shows the difference between a candidate’s share of the postal vote and their share of all other vote types. Incumbents (or candidates of incumbent parties) are denoted with filled circles, challengers are shown with open circles; data for C200-supported independents are coloured teal; Sharkie (XEN; Mayo, SA) and Katter (KAP; Kennedy, QLD) are denoted as IND for inclusion in the graph. Data are randomly jittered in the horizontal dimension to show the density of the data and to avoid overplotting. Roll over each data point to display details.\n\n\n\nMost independent candidacies are quixotic, generating low vote shares that vary little across vote types; as show in Figure 2, postal vote shares for most independents are identical to their vote shares in other forms of voting.\nBut like Labor and Coalition candidates, incumbent independents tend to do better among postal votes than among other forms of voting. For non-incumbent independents, including the successful, C200-supported candidates, their performance among postal vote lags their performance across over types of voting, and by substantial margins.\n\n\nPostal vote performance and incumbency\nWe look closer at relative performance in postal votes (RPV), comparing established, incumbent independents and independents challenging incumbents (or candidates of incumbent parties).\nWe also include data from 2019 — when at least two of 2022’s incumbent independents were challengers (Haines and Steggall) — to start to assess the role of incumbency as a predictor of postal vote performance. Further, in 2019, Kerryn Phelps was the independent incumbent in Wentworth, challenged successfully by Dave Sharma, who in turn was challenged successfully by independent Allegra Spender in 2022.\nThese within-division comparisons have the benefit of holding constant any time-invariant, divisional-level factors that might influence the postal vote performance of independents, while at the same time capturing some variation in the incumbency status of independent candidates.\nTable 4 presents data from this relatively small set of independent candidacies, showing (a) the level of postal vote performance relative to other vote types for both 2019 and 2022 (RPV), (b) the change (∆) in RPV as well as (c) the prevalence of postal voting in the division in 2019 and 2022 and (d) change in prevalance. We also note the incumbency status of the independent candidate in each case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis small number of cases highlights again that (a) incumbent independents typically do better in postal votes than in other forms of voting; (b) that becoming an incumbent boosts postal vote performance, as evidenced by the experience of Haines (Indi, VIC) and Steggall (Warringah, NSW), both transitioning relative under-performance among postals to over-performance as they transitioned from challenger to incumbent between the 2019 and 2022 elections:\n\nHaines’ relative performance among postal votes (RPV) goes from -4.0 to +1.5 between 2019 and 2022, a gain of 5.5 percentage points;\nSteggall’s RPV rises from -6.8 as a challenger in 2019 to +1.6 in 2022, a gain of 8.4 percentage points.\n\nThese two data points can be distinguished from the changes in RPVs for independent candidates who did not transition from challenger to incumbent:\n\nSharkie (Mayo, SA) also sees a 5.5 improvement in RPV as an incumbent in both elections, the same as Haines, while Wilkie’s RPV falls -1.2 percentage points.\nChanges in RPV for the other cases — -4.0 for Dyson (Wannon, VIC), a challenger in both elections, and -1.2 Spender relative to Phelps (Wentworth NSW) — further suggest that incumbency is positively associated with RPV.\n\nMoreover, changes in the prevalence of postal voting are almost constant over this set of divisions, with little prospect of any confounding of the effect of incumbency on RPV with the increase in the use of postal voting between 2019 and 2022.\n\n\n\nStatistical tests confirm that incumbency promotes postal vote performance. We estimate regressions of 2019-to-2022 change in RPV, with two predictors:\n\nchange in incumbency between 2019 and 2022 (+1 for 2019 challenger to 2022 incumbent, 0 for no change and -1 for 2019 incumbent to 2022 challenger)\nchange in the prevalence of postal voting in each division, 2019 to 2022, so that estimates of the incumbency changes are net of any effects on RPV due to the increase in the prevalence of postal voting.\n\nWe estimate this regression separately for Coalition, Independent candidates and Labor candidates. Green candidates are omitted from this “differences-in-differences” analysis, since there is no variation in the incumbency status of Greens candidates between 2019 and 2022, with Adam Bandt remaining the sole Greens House of Representatives incumbent in both elections. We also fit this model to differences in relative performance in votes cast at pre-poll voting centres (PPVC), the other vote type to surge in popularity in 2022.\nFigure 3 presents these regression-based estimates of the effects of a transition to incumbency in graphical form: points correspond to the magnitude of the estimated effects and vertical lines cover 95% confidence intervals.\nAs foreshadowed in the tables and charts above, the effects of transitioning to incumbency are large for independents, and are also positive and distinguishable from zero for Coalition (1.4, \\(t\\) = 1.8) and Labor candidates (1.9, \\(t\\) = 2.2). No such effects are found in the case of “pre-poll” votes, the other voting type to surge in popularity in 2022.\n\n\n\n\nregdata = transpose(regression_tmp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot.plot({\n  grid: true,\n  width: 1000,\n  height: 1000,\n  marginTop: 52,\n  insetTop: -6,\n  insetBottom: 2,\n  \n  style: {\n    fontSize: \"16px\"\n  },\n  \n  y: {\n    ticks: 12,\n    tickFormat: \"+\",\n    label: \"Effect of change in incumbency on change in RPV ↑\"\n  },\n  \n  x: {\n    label: \"\"\n  },\n\n  facet: {\n    data: regdata,\n    x: \"Type\",\n    marginLeft: 0,\n    marginTop: 22\n  },\n    \n  fx: {\n    padding: 0.1,\n    label: \"\"\n  },\n  \n  marks: [\n  \n    Plot.ruleY([0], {stroke: \"#333\"}),\n  \n    Plot.link(regdata,\n    {\n      x: \"party_group\",\n      y1: \"lo\",\n      y2: \"up\",\n      stroke: (d) => d.color,\n      strokeWidth: 4\n    }\n    ),\n  \n    Plot.dot(regdata,\n        {\n          y: \"estimate\",\n          x: \"party_group\",\n          r: 8,\n          title: (d) => `${d3.format(\".1f\")(d.estimate)} \\n (t = ${d3.format(\".1f\")(d.statistic)}) \\n n = ${d.n}`,\n          stroke: (d) => d.color,\n          fill: (d) => d.color\n        }\n    )\n\n    \n  ],\n  \n  tooltip: {\n  }  \n  \n})\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Effect of change in incumbency status on change in relative postal voting performance.

As postal votes continue to grow in popularity, understanding the mechanisms by which this advantage arises will be vital as a general proposition, but in particular for C200-supported independents, holding seats traditionally considered Coalition-strongholds, seats in which the use of postal voting is higher than average.\nIn addition to quantitative data analysis, qualitative work with established, incumbent independents (Steggall, Haines, Sharkie, Wilkie) will help shed light on these mechanisms.\nSection 90B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act entitles successful House of Representatives candidates to a version of the electoral roll with postal voting information appended for each voter; in particular see section 90B(10). Analysis of that information will be vital in helping answer the questions posed above, and to ensure that postal voting etc are not points of vulnerability for Independent candidates in future elections.\nPooling this information from the AEC across multiple divisions would strengthen the analytical power and practical utility of this proposed analysis.\nGiven restrictions on access to the electoral roll, legal advice can inform if and how this combined analysis can be undertaken."
